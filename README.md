# Mission to Mars


## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a webpage and dynamic table that allows users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time for a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. 


## Results

Users can enter a search term corresponding to the appropriate search field for date, city, state, country, and shape.

- single filter search:
    A user can search for UFO sightings in the table using only one search field such as specifying the state, ie "ca" for California and pressing enter. The table will return all UFO sightings that the state column equals "ca".

- Multiple filter search:
    A user can further filter the results displayed in the table by filling in the other search fields, reducing the number of results. An example would be filtering the results for California sightings that had a shape equal to "triangle". The user would enter "ca" in the state filter box and "triangle" in the shape filter box.

## Summary

The multiple fields the user can use to filter the table work as intended and do allow for a more customizable analysis of UFO sightings. However, as the webpage is designed case sensitivity is a possible drawback. The filter fields are lower cased sensitive, meaning the user must enter the criteria in lowercase to successfully filter the table. Removing case sensitivity of entered criteria would allow for more flexibility and ease of use for the user. 

Additionally, to further improve user experience, adding a colored underline to the filter boxes when the cursor is active in it will visually identify to the user which search box they are currently typing in.

The suggested design adjustments will further support the user's experience when filtering the table for specific sightings.
